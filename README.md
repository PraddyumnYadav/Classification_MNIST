# Classification on MNIST Dataset
- This Repository Contains a Machine Learning Model with sklearn Which is driven from "Hands on Machine Learning"
- In This Repository We Use Scikit-Learn, Jupyter Notebook, Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib.
- Most Probaby i Will Work on GUI and Website of This Project Which Will not be Hosted.
# How to Run This on Your Local Computer System.
- Firstly Clone The Repository.
```
git clone git@github.com:PraddyumnYadav/Classification_MNIST.git
```
```
https://github.com/PraddyumnYadav/Classification_MNIST.git
```
- Create a Virtual Enviornment.
```
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
```
- Activate The Virtual Enviornment in Linux.
```
source ./venv/bin/activate
```
- Install All the Dependencies.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Now You Are Ready for Running This Projet on Your Local Machine.
